"""
Install a NimaLTD library into your STM32 project.

Run it from the root of your project. It works two ways, depending on whether
this file has a library sitting next to it.

    python install.py
        You downloaded this repository into your project, so the library is
        already here. Nothing is asked. The repository folder becomes a plain
        library folder: the header and source move to the top, your config file
        is created, and everything belonging to the repository rather than your
        firmware is removed.

        That last part matters. STM32CubeIDE compiles every .c file under your
        project, and this repository ships a test suite with its own main(),
        which would break your build.

    python install.py fsm
        This file is on its own, so the library is fetched from GitHub. You are
        asked which folder to put it in. Only the files the library actually
        needs are downloaded.

Your own <library>_config.h is never overwritten, so either form is also how you
update.

Nothing is installed on your machine. The installer itself is fetched into a
temporary folder, used, and deleted. No pip, no packages, no leftovers, and you
always get the current version because there is never an old one lying around.
